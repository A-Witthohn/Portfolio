# Aaron Witthohn Portfolio



## User Story

The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate the knowledge learned in the UNC Bootcamp week two. This assignment specifically focuses on HTML and Advanced CSS. I was able to demostrate this by creating from scratch an index.html file, and style sheet, and implementing a recommended reset sheet created by Vladimir Carrer [Vladimir Carrer Reset Repo](https://github.com/vladocar/CSS-Mini-Reset). Ultilizing those tools allowed I was able to meet all the Acceptance Criteria below. Throughout the index.html file and style.css file there are comments noting where and what is happening to the page. All images are placeholders used to demostrate my understanding of tools such as flex, display, and the hover ability (hero image excluded on hover). The largest image was made a link to my demo page of the site with the intention demonstating how to use the proper link. additionally all links have had style changes and functionally tested.  


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application *(For this demonstration I used the largest image in my Portfolio Section)*
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Template / Demo

In this section you will find three images all of which show the pages ability to be responsive at different dimensions. This page was specifically designed with three dimensions in mind. Those dimensions are as follows, Small (500x850), Medium (800x850), Large (1200x850) Each of the demo pages has a different image highlighted to reiterate the pages hover design to bring the color back to each image in the portfolio section.
